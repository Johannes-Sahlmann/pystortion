If you use `pystortion` for work/research presented in a publication (whether
directly, or as a dependency to another package), we recommend and encourage
the following acknowledgment:

  This research made use of pystortion, an open source Python package
  for distortion determination in astronomical imagers (Sahlmann et al, 2019).
